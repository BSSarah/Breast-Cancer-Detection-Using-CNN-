Breast tumor detection using convolutional neural networks( a binary classifier of mammogram images "Normal", "Abnormal (Tumor)".
In order to use the classification app ("templates/main.html", or main.html file) 
you have to Restat then RunAll the   code in the jupyter notebook 
(BCDraft01C.ipynb), that will create a "BCDraft01C.h5" file.
To use the code or test it, you can download directly the zip file "BreastTumorDetection.zip".
Thank you.
